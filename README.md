## Gameplay

### Set up:
Start with 1 Red Player and up to 4 Blue Players. Another Red Player should join the game for every fifth Blue Player added.

Every Blue Player will control a Sector with 3 Facilities each. Each Facility will have different Sector Products and Resistance Points. All players will have 2 Workers of each color with Red Players having an additional Colorless Worker. 

All players begin play by drawing 5 cards from their decks


### Turn Order:
1. Every third turn a White Card is drawn.
2. Red Player(s) take their turn.
3. Blue player(s) take their turn.


### Turn Composition:
1. **DRAW PHASE:** Players must draw until they have 5 cards in their hand. If a player cannot draw any more cards the game ends. Players can discard and redraw up to 2 cards. 
    - Any Workers used in the previous turn are replenished. Workers can work Overtime for 2 turns, adding 2 Workers per color to a Sector. After 2 turns, Workers enter exhaustion for 4 turns, limiting a Sector to 1 Worker per color.

2. **ACTION PHASE:** Players are able to activate their cards by using the required number of Workers as indicated by each card.

3. **END TURN PHASE:** Players must discard their cards until they have 5 cards left in their hand. During this phase, players can donate any remaining Workers to their allies.


### White Cards:
These cards are split into two decks, a Positive Deck and a Negative Deck. Every third turn a card is drawn starting from the Negative Deck. Once 2 cards are drawn from the Negative Deck a card is drawn from the Positive Deck, this pattern continues until there are no more cards in the Positive Deck.


### Red Players:
#### Colorless Worker:
Red Players have 1 Colorless Worker which can be used in place of any other regular Worker. 


#### Backdoor: 
An effect placed on Blue Facilities that is required for Red Players to play stronger cards. This effect remains for 3 turns or until it is removed.


### Blue Players:
#### Fortified:
An effect placed on Blue Facilities that prevents any Backdoors from being placed on a Facility while active and removes any Backdoors already on a Facility. This effect remains for 3 turns or until it is removed.


## Ending the Game: 
**The game ends when one of the following conditions are met** 

#### Running Out of Cards: 
When there are no more cards in a playerâ€™s deck then the game is over and the opposing team wins. 


#### Running Out of Turns:
When the game has reached the end of turn 30, the game ends and Blue Players win.


#### Facilities Down: 
If all Facilities in every Sector are down the Red Players win. 


#### Doom Clock:
If half of all Sectors are down or a Core Sector (Energy, Communication, Water, Information Technology) has 2 or more of their Facilities down at the same time the Blue Players have only 3 turns to have more than half of all Sectors online or to restore the Core Sector. If Blue Players manages this then the Doom Clock resets to 3 turns. If 3 turns have passed the Red Players win.
